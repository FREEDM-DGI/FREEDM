Building This Project

1. Begin by installing Boost. We recommend installing the version of Boost
provided by your system's package manager. Old systems may require you to
manually build a newer version, since we may make use of relatively new Boost
features. We currently test FREEDM on Boost 1.50. See the Boost website for
assistance if you think you will need to build this version yourself.

2. Navigate to the `Broker` directory within the source you cloned from GitHub
and invoke `cmake .` This will prepare the makefile.

3. Call `make` and wait for the FREEDM project to build.

4. Refer to the FREEDM Wiki at https://github.com/scj7t4/FREEDM/wiki for
information on configuration.
