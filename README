##Building This Project

1. Begin by installing boost. You may be able to use your system's provided
boost package, or you may need to begin by downloading boost 1.44 (which is
known to work) from http://www.boost.org/users/history/

1. If you are using a boost package skip to 4.
If you aren't using a package of boost, build it by extracting the source
tarball you downloaded to your home directory, navigating to it and invoking
`bjam` which, assuming you have all the right packages installed, will build
boost.

1. Next, define the BOOST_ROOT environment variable in your `.bashrc` by setting
it to the directory you build boost in. For example
`export BOOST_ROOT='~/boost/'` should be added to your `.bashrc`.

1. Navigate to the `Broker` directory within the source you cloned from github
and invoke `cmake .` This will prepare all the makefiles.

1. Lastly, call make and wait for the FREEDM project to build.
